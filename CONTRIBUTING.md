## Contibuting bypasses

### Making the bypass
Initially, you may use the custom bypasses section on the extension's settings page to test out and formulate your bypass, but after that we reccomend using a code editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)/[Codium](https://vscodium.com/#install).

### Submitting a Pull Request

When submitting a pull please take care that:
- Your code follows [the code style](docs/CODE_STYLE.md#code-style)
- Commit messages should be descriptive
- If its a small change [squash all your commits](docs/Git_CLI.md#squashing-commits)
- Follow the pull request template

Consider joining the [Discord](https://discord.gg/RSAf7b5njt) so that we can discuss the PR in real time.
