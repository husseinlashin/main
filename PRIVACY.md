# FastForward Privacy Policy

## Auto-updating

In order to provide up-to-date bypasses, FastForward sends a request to Github every hour, and if a new commit is found, it will download the latest "injection script."

For this, [Github's privacy policy](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement) applies.

## Crowd Bypass

When Crowd Bypass (Options > "Give and take the destinations of unbypassable shorteners.") is enabled, ocassionally the extension will send requests to our server:

- When you visit a known unbypassable shortener website, the URL is sent so it can check against the database if someone else has already reported its destination.
- When you complete your visit on such a website, the URL and destination URL are sent so it can be recorded for future visitors.

To prevent abuse, we log a hashed version of your IP address in our database when you submit a link. Only the developers have access to the database.
